# 2022 Objectives

1. Use my bullet journal more effectively.
    * **Purpose**: Document what is going, embrace the concept of *rapid logging*, write it down now and make sense of it later.
    * **Challenges**: Remembering to bring the journal with me, finding space on my desk to keep it open, finding capability to make notes when not engaged in traditional sitting at my desk and working (i.e., with kids, away from desk, etc).

2. Get off social media.
    * **Purpose**: Reduce negative feedback / FOMO / echo chamber by not looking at social media.
    * **Challenge**: Need to use some social media for work - remove company from social media? Outsource social media to a VA?

3. More systematic, organized approach to work.
    * **Purpose**: Instead of waking up and thinking about what I need to do that day, have it already pre-planned and organized.
    * **Challenge**: Need to be better about documenting and assigning dates to work, and respecting those dates.
    * **Starting Point**: Start by leaning on ClientHub, get into habit of checking daily 'to-do' log and reviewing bullet journal for items to either diarize in ClientHub or tackle quickly.
