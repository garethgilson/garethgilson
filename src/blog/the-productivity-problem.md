# The Productivity Problem

I'm not sure if I'm stuck in an Internet echo chamber, or if this is just the way it is, but I seem to see a lot of articles and websites that want to tell me the five things you didn't know your local bank could do, or top ten things to do first thing in the morning for productivity.

The problem with those two things is invariably that my local bank can't do those things, because I'm in Canada and not the United States, and although those ten things to do first thing in the morning sound great, I could only get through maybe one or two, if any, before one or both of my kids wake up and demand my attention. Or I've already been up late or up in the middle of the night dealing with something they needed.

Not sure what the solution is, but more Canadian sites and more blogs for parents will need to be part of it.
